# IRC-Bot
IRC-bot made for Twitch in Python 3.7 that doesn't work


I have about 7 hours until I have to hand in a python project, decided to go with a python twitch bot.
What I have right now does work, but it's minimal and bare-bones, not enough for anything sufficient, 
but I'm tired and my teammates have not helped so I need someone to save my ass.
I have given up on a loyalty/reward system, but I want to add text commands to make it passable.
